  <h1>Science Bowl Tryouts</h1>

  <ng-container *ngIf="!started">
    <p>Welcome to the online tryouts for the Montgomery Blair High School Science Bowl Team! The following questions are designed to test your knowledge of the six Science Bowl subjects: physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, earth and space science, and energy. All questions are multiple choice and have strict time limits ranging from 10 to 45 seconds. There are 50 questions, and overall, we estimate that the test will require less than half an hour.</p>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>

    <p>One (1) point will be awarded for all correct answers. Zero (0) points are awarded for unanswered questions (either skipped or time expired). In Science Bowl competition, reckless guessing has the potential to hurt teams by taking away scoring opportunities and possibly giving up an interrupt penalty. Therefore, in order to discourage guessing, three quarters (0.75) of a point will be subtracted for all incorrect answers.</p>

    <h3>Integrity</h3>

    <p>The captains have worked tirelessly to produce this tryout and these questions. During the tryout, you can only consult your own knowledge of the subjects! Any violation of the integrity of this tryout will be reported to appropriate school authorities. Violations include, but are not limited to, consulting any reference source (including textbooks or notes), searching the Internet, or using a calculator. Additionally, no discussion of the contents of the tryout are permitted with anyone else (besides a captain) until the tryout window ends.</p>
